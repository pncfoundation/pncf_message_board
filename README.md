# PNCF Message Board

This web application is built using Vue.js (Front-End), Node.js (Back-End), and MySQL (Database)

## Purpose

In order to provide a safe location for people to vent and share their thoughts anonymously, the PNCF
is offering this message board. This is to help address mental wellness issues as well as bring 
more attention to it. 

Anyone can submit a message to be posted on the message board and no account is needed. 
The moderators have the ability to reject and delete message they find inappropriate from
the message board.

# Front-End

The web application utilizes Vue.js on top of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 


# Back-End

The server utilizes Node.js on top on Javascript. This allows the front-end to communicate the 
database, so it contains files over the database structure.
